# Java-Development-Intern-Tasks
This repository contains a collection of Java projects I have completed as part of my learning journey.  
The projects are organized into different **levels** based on complexity — starting with beginner-friendly programs and gradually moving toward advanced applications involving **OOP, File Handling, JDBC, and Multithreading**.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🟢 Level 1 — Basics
1. **Basic Calculator** → Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
2. **Number Guessing Game** → Simple console game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.  
3. **Factorial Calculation** → Program to compute the factorial of a number using loops/recursion.

### 🟡 Level 2 — Intermediate
1. **File Handling (Read & Write)** → Read from and write data to a file using Java I/O streams.  
2. **Simple Banking Application** → Deposit, withdraw, and check balance with a basic banking logic and user interaction.
3. **Employee Management System (OOP)** → Demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

### 🔴 Level 3 — Advanced
1. **Library Management System (JDBC)** →  
   - CRUD operations for Books and Users  
   - Borrow/Return functionality with transaction records  
   - Uses **MySQL Database + JDBC** for connectivity  

2. **Multithreaded Chat Application** →  
   - Console-based chat app  
   - Uses **Java Sockets + Multithreading**  
   - Multiple clients can connect and chat simultaneously  

3. **Binary Search Implementation** →  
   - Implementation of **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
   - Supports insertion, deletion, search, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
